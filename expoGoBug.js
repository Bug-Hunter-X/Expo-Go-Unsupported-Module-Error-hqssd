This error typically occurs when you try to use a module or feature that isn't supported in the Expo Go environment. Expo Go is a runtime environment for Expo applications and doesn't include all the functionalities available in a native build.

For example, if your code uses native modules that require platform-specific code (like accessing the device's camera using the react-native-camera library without using the Expo Camera API), it won't work in Expo Go. Similarly, if you use libraries that rely on features not available in the Expo Go runtime environment, you'll encounter this issue.

The error message itself might not explicitly mention Expo Go but will indicate an underlying incompatibility or missing module.  You may see errors related to missing native modules or runtime exceptions.
